Notepad++ is an actively maintained piece of software, and new versions come fast. There are basically three ways to keep abreast of changes:

Enabling the Auto Update feature. When a new version is released, and after some delay - 15 days, you will be notified that a new version is available, and presented with the option of installing that newer version.
Using the ? -> Update Notepad++ command. This will check whether there is a new version and whether the safety delay is over. If so, you are presented with the opportunity to download and install the newer version.
Going to the main website and downloading the latest installer or zipped archive.
The safety delay is provided so that, in case a critical bug is spotted on a new release, a corrective release is done quickly enough, preventing bad bugs to become widespread.
